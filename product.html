            <p>
                The mushrooms that top this pizza are simmered in a white wine reduction, which gives them a zippy sweet and acidic bite.
                A great pizza has the right balance of sauce, cheese, and crust — but don't forget about the toppings! While most toppings 
                can just be chopped up and tossed onto the pizza before baking, there are a few that should be precooked first for better 
                texture and flavor.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced flatbreads with toppings. The word pizza was first documented in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. The precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added. Modern pizza developed in Naples, when tomato was added to the focaccia in the late 18th century.

                The paneer that top this pizza are made from dairy products that give you good taste of milk and butter.
