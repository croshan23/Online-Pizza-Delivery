            <li> Responsive Design
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Responsive Web configuration is the approach that recommends that plan and improvement ought to react to the client's conduct and condition in view of screen size, stage and introduction. The practice comprises of a blend of adaptable frameworks and designs, pictures and a smart utilization of CSS media questions.

                        Responsive Web Design makes your page look great on all gadgets (desktops, tablets, and telephones).
                        Generally, the overflow data is seen on other parts of website.
                    </li>
                    <li>I have used responsive design in navigation of the website. We can check it by reducing the width of the browser
                        which results in showing the navigation menus as tiles of menu.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
         
            <li> Psuedo Classes
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Psuedo Classes is utilized to pull in clients about the components utilized as a part of site. For example, a stay label makes the connection underlined naturally. Which doesn't look great. Thus, we expel underline from it. The outcome makes the connection look as other content in site. Thus, utilizing psuedo class we can highlight the connections as needs be to make client think about the connections.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The utilization of psuedo class to change the presence of Links and highlight it makes the site more easy to use. It can distint joins from different writings.
                    </li>
                    <li>I have used psuedo class in about.html page under "Email Link" and footer's email link. To check it one can hover over it to see the change in color of
                        the link.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
            </li>
